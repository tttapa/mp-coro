> We DO NOT need to inline the body of the coroutine or the algorithm 
> `accumulate`, unless the iterator type retains a pointer or reference to the
> `generator<int>` object.

> Note that authors of coroutine types should be aware of this point: at least
> one blogger has described an implementation of `generator<T>::iterator` that
> holds a `generator<T>*`. However, every implementation of `generator<T>` we
> can find in the wild holds a `coroutine_handle<Promise>` instead, which avoids
> the problem, and allows heap allocation elision without inlining accumulate.
